# A new model of brain reward circuitry
 Contains files related to the revised and resubmitted manuscript: Trujillo-Pisanty, I., Conover, K., Solis, P., Palacios, D., & Shizgal, P. Dopamine neurons do not constitute an obligatory stage in the final common path for the evaluation and pursuit of brain stimulation reward, PLOS ONE, 2020, in press. 

The previous version of this manuscript was entitled: The effect of dopamine transporter blockade on optical self-stimulation: behavioral and computational evidence for parallel processing in brain reward circuitry and is posted here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/867481v1.full

Figures.pdf contains the 12 figures for the main manuscript (manuscript.pdf), whereas supporting_information_figures.pdf contains the 37 figures for the supporting-information file, supporting_information_text.pdf. 

Matlab_Live_Script.mlx contains the simulation code associated with the manuscript. External figures imported by the Live Script are contained in Imported_figures_for_Live_Script.zip. 

The Live Script should run on any version of Matlab from R2018a onwards. The script hasnâ€™t been tested on earlier versions, but it may run on versions as far back as R2016a.

Live-Script_instructions.pdf explains how to install and run the Live Script. Matlab_Live_Script.html displays the Live Script in a browser.
