# A new model of brain reward circuitry
 Contains files related to the revised and resubmitted manuscript: Trujillo-Pisanty, I., Conover, K., Solis, P., Palacios, D., & Shizgal, P. Dopamine neurons do not constitute an obligatory stage in the final common path for the evaluation and pursuit of brain stimulation reward. 

The previous version of this manuscript was entitled: The effect of dopamine transporter blockade on optical self-stimulation: behavioral and computational evidence for parallel processing in brain reward circuitry and is posted here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/867481v1.full

Figures.pdf contains the 12 figures for the main manuscript (manuscript.pdf), whereas supporting_information_figures.pdf contains the 37 figures for the supporting-information file, supporting_information_text.pdf. 

Matlab_Live_Script.mlx contains the simulation code associated with the manuscript. This file should run on recent versions of Matlab (it was created in R2019b). Live-Script_instructions.pdf explains how to install and run the Live Script. Matlab_Live_Script.html displays the Live Script in a browser.
